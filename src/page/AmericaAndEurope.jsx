                            It was built by Gustave Eiffel to commemorate the centenary of the French Revolution
                            and its inauguration coincided with the Paris World Exposition of 1889.
                            Although in the beginning it was not to the liking of all Parisians,
                            and even became provisional (in theory it would be dismantled in 1900),
                            gradually people got used to the nicknamed "La Dame de Fer" (the Iron Lady)
                            to become the greatest symbol of Paris. It has a height of 324 meters and is arranged
                            in three levels, accessible with different tickets
                            (depending on the level you want to visit and whether or not you use the elevator
                            the price changes). But while you're at it, we recommend you to climb to the top,
                            at 276 meters high, to enjoy wonderful views of Paris and some of its main tourist
                            attractions (which we told you about in this post). If you want to enjoy the tower
                            but without climbing it, the best place to see it is from the Trocadero Gardens,
                            on the other side of the Seine River. Price: stairs 2nd floor: 10,50€ /
                            elevator 2nd floor: 16,70€ / stairs 2nd floor + elevator to the top: 19,90€ /
                            elevator to the top: 26,10€. Book your ticket in advance on their official website.</p>

                            Lisbon
                            The feeling of nostalgia runs through the streets of the city that always seems very far away. Lisbon is that city that seems to belong to another era. It is marked by very narrow roads, the viewpoints of its sky and its ocean. With a light that allows you to take a momentary walk into each person's past just by resting your eyes on its cobblestone floors and its old-style houses.
                            Edinburgh
                            Every year, Edinburgh is filled with more than hundreds of millions of tourists in search of cultural shows and nightlife fun. The Scottish capital always offers good spirits, and the desires and/or longing for colossal fun at night with the moon at its highest level. This place is an attractive space of culture culminating in the summer dates in the midst of the most beautiful celebration and celebration of the International Festival in honor of the artists and stage shows.
                            London
                            If you want to receive a dose of European culture, appreciate monuments from all eras, you must visit London. It is an important emblem of the continent. The architecture of its churches and museums are complemented by natural spaces visible to the public, with avant-garde details and respect for always maintaining its indisputable cosmopolitanism. This makes the city the most visited in the world. Obviously, after the cities of Hong Kong and Singapore.

                                </li>

                                I will be quick and concise, clear sentences with the most important information for a trip to Malta.
                                <li>
                                    The Republic of Malta is a European Union country, so if you have an EU SIM card, you can browse and call as if you were in your own country.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    In Malta, said by a taxi driver, "he who speaks only two languages ​​is either stupid or lazy." In Malta they speak English, Maltese, Italian and, depending on the person, French, Portuguese and Spanish.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The islands are quite small. The largest, Malta, can be traveled from end to end by car in just one hour.
                                    In Malta they drive on the left.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The distances are quite short but public transport still takes longer than expected to make a seemingly short route.
                                    Malta is a very safe place.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    It is located in a strategic location in the middle of the Mediterranean that makes it a very interesting destination on a historical level.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    The island of Malta is the largest of the entire archipelago, although this information is not very relevant either since it is almost three times smaller than the Community of Madrid (which is not particularly large).
                                    What is relevant, on the contrary, is the fact that the population density is the highest of all the countries in the European Union.
