                                It is essential that we choose the suitcase that is most convenient and comfortable for our trip,
                                since the amount of storage space will depend on it.
                                For the selection we must take into account the specifications of the airline with which we will travel
                                regarding luggage:

                                Handheld: standard measurements are 25 x 35 x 55 cm;
                                For wine cellars: they can weigh 23 kg and up to 158 linear cm (length, width and height);
                                Pets: traveling with our pet is possible; The maximum weight of the soft kennel is 6 kg, and if it is for a

                                Designing a travel list will be one of the most important things to do when packing your luggage, since it will help you to organize your luggage efficiently and will allow you to make the most of all the space available.
                                will help us to organize ourselves in an efficient way and will allow us to take advantage of all the space to the maximum.

                                It is a perfect idea to check everything we are going to keep and make sure we don't forget anything at all;
                                basically it is a checklist of essential items.

                                Also, if you are a frequent traveler, the list will help you realize if everything you wrote down you used it
                                or simply it was not necessary to take it, this way, the next time you pack your suitcase you can save even more space.

                                There are many types of organizers, but the best known and most practical are the packing cube compressor,
                                ideal for saving space in your suitcase.

                                They are bags that can come in different sizes, fabrics and colors, excellent to have our suitcase tidy and reduce
                                tidy suitcase and reduce the volume up to 50% less.

                                It is very easy to assemble: we roll the clothes, we place them inside the packing cube
                                (we should not try to put more clothes), we close it and it will be compressed, and finally, it has another zipper that closes it,
                                It has another zipper that will compress even more when we close it. Excellent, don't you think?

                                This is a very useful and important travel accessory to avoid theft and loss of documents, money and passport. It is called variously as dole, pochete money and dollar holder. But rest assured that it is not a fanny pack that is left on the outside, which many people refuse to use.

                                This fanny pack is super thin and made of a very comfortable fabric to fit inside your pants. That's why it's so secure and impossible to get stolen or lose your money, passport or cards. It is a travel item that is increasingly used by tourists.</p>
